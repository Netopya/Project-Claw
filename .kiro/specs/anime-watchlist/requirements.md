# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Project Claw is a Node.js-based web application that allows users to manage a prioritized list of anime they want to watch. The application integrates with the MyAnimeList API to automatically fetch anime information from URLs, stores data locally in SQLite, and provides an intuitive interface for organizing anime by watch priority through drag-and-drop reordering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anime enthusiast, I want to add anime to my watchlist by pasting MyAnimeList URLs, so that I can quickly build my list without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a MyAnimeList URL THEN the system SHALL parse the anime ID from the URL
2. WHEN the system receives a valid anime ID THEN the system SHALL fetch anime details from the MyAnimeList API
3. WHEN anime data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL extract title, image URL, and rating information
4. WHEN anime data is processed THEN the system SHALL add the anime to the user's watchlist with default priority
5. IF the anime already exists in the watchlist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and not create a duplicate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my anime in a visual list with their details, so that I can easily browse my watchlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the watchlist THEN the system SHALL display all anime in priority order
2. WHEN displaying anime THEN the system SHALL show the title, cover image, and rating for each item
3. WHEN the list loads THEN the system SHALL order anime by their current priority position
4. WHEN no anime exist in the watchlist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reorder anime in my list by dragging and dropping, so that I can prioritize what I want to watch next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags an anime item THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the drag operation
2. WHEN a user drops an anime item in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the priority order immediately
3. WHEN the order is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the new order to the database
4. WHEN reordering is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the new order across page refreshes
5. WHEN multiple users access the same data THEN the system SHALL reflect the most recent order changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove anime from my watchlist, so that I can clean up my list after watching or losing interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the remove option for an anime THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
2. WHEN the user confirms removal THEN the system SHALL delete the anime from the database
3. WHEN an anime is removed THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
4. WHEN an anime is removed THEN the system SHALL adjust the priority order of remaining items

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MyAnimeList API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN an invalid URL is provided THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest the correct format
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a maintenance message
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options where appropriate
5. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform the user of delays

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my watchlist data to persist locally, so that my data is always available and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anime is added to the watchlist THEN the system SHALL store all data in a local SQLite database
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity through proper transactions
4. WHEN the application is restarted THEN the system SHALL restore the complete watchlist state
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt recovery where possible
