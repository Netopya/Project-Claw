# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Anime Series Timeline feature enhances the existing anime watchlist application by providing comprehensive series relationship mapping and chronological ordering. This feature addresses the limitation where only immediate prequels and sequels are shown, instead exploring the complete anime relationship graph to present users with a full chronological timeline of related anime series. The feature separates anime information storage from the user's personal watchlist, allowing for comprehensive series data while maintaining user preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anime enthusiast, I want to see the complete chronological timeline of an anime series, so that I can understand the full watch order including all related entries, spin-offs, and alternative versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes an anime THEN it SHALL explore all related anime relationships recursively to build a complete series graph
2. WHEN building the series graph THEN the system SHALL handle complex relationships including prequels, sequels, side stories, alternative versions, and parent series
3. WHEN the series graph is complete THEN the system SHALL flatten it into a chronologically ordered list based on premiere dates
4. WHEN chronological ordering is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use relationship types and episode counts as secondary sorting criteria
5. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN the system SHALL show each anime's position in the chronological sequence

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see timeline badges on my anime cards that show the chronological sequence of the series, so that I can quickly understand where each anime fits in the overall timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying an anime card THEN the system SHALL show timeline badges representing the chronological sequence of related anime
2. WHEN showing timeline badges THEN the system SHALL display the type (TV, Movie, OVA, Special), year, and episode count for each entry
3. WHEN a user hovers over a timeline badge THEN the system SHALL display the full title and additional details in a popover
4. WHEN the current anime is part of the timeline THEN the system SHALL highlight its position in the sequence
5. WHEN timeline badges exceed available space THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling or truncation with expansion options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a separate anime information database from the watchlist, so that I can store comprehensive series data without cluttering the user's personal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a new anime THEN it SHALL store complete anime information in a dedicated anime database table
2. WHEN storing anime information THEN the system SHALL include all metadata needed for timeline generation including relationships, dates, and episode counts
3. WHEN a user adds anime to their watchlist THEN the system SHALL reference the anime information table rather than duplicating data
4. WHEN anime information is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between the anime database and user watchlists
5. WHEN the database is reset THEN the system SHALL be able to rebuild both anime information and watchlist data from scratch

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle complex anime relationship graphs correctly, so that I get accurate timeline information even for series with complicated interconnections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing anime relationships THEN the system SHALL detect and handle circular references without infinite loops
2. WHEN encountering branching storylines THEN the system SHALL include all branches in the timeline while maintaining chronological order
3. WHEN processing alternative versions THEN the system SHALL group them appropriately while preserving their chronological positions
4. WHEN handling parent-child relationships THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the main timeline versus spin-offs and side stories
5. WHEN relationship data is incomplete or conflicting THEN the system SHALL make reasonable assumptions and log uncertainties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the timeline feature to work efficiently even with large series collections, so that I can browse my watchlist without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building series timelines THEN the system SHALL cache processed relationship graphs to avoid repeated API calls
2. WHEN displaying timeline badges THEN the system SHALL load efficiently without blocking the main UI
3. WHEN the anime database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain fast query performance through proper indexing
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent timeline generation without conflicts
5. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL queue timeline processing and provide progress feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want timeline information to be automatically updated when new related anime are discovered, so that my series timelines remain current and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new anime are added to the system THEN the system SHALL check for relationships with existing anime and update timelines accordingly
2. WHEN anime relationships change in the source data THEN the system SHALL detect and incorporate these changes
3. WHEN timeline updates occur THEN the system SHALL refresh affected anime cards without requiring page reloads
4. WHEN relationship processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and maintain partial timeline data
5. WHEN timeline data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to refresh and rebuild timelines
