# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides users with the ability to export all database data to a file and import data from a file back into the database. This functionality enables users to backup their anime data, migrate between instances, or share their collections with others.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export all my anime database data to a file, so that I can create backups or migrate my data to another instance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the export/import page THEN the system SHALL display an export button
2. WHEN the user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable file containing all anime data
3. WHEN the export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a success message with the file download
4. IF the database is empty THEN the system SHALL still allow export and create an empty data file
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all anime records with their complete metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import anime data from a file, so that I can restore backups or load data from another source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the export/import page THEN the system SHALL display a file upload area for import
2. WHEN the user selects a valid data file THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the data to be imported
3. WHEN the user confirms the import THEN the system SHALL process the file and add the data to the database
4. IF the import file contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
5. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate entries appropriately
6. WHEN the import is complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the number of records imported

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose how to handle existing data during import, so that I can control whether to merge or replace my current collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL provide options for handling existing data (merge or replace)
2. IF the user selects "replace" THEN the system SHALL clear existing data before importing
3. IF the user selects "merge" THEN the system SHALL add new records and update existing ones based on unique identifiers
4. WHEN duplicate records are detected during merge THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
5. WHEN processing duplicates THEN the system SHALL allow the user to choose which version to keep

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the export/import process to be secure and reliable, so that my data is protected and the process doesn't corrupt my database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before creating the export file
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure before processing
3. IF an error occurs during import THEN the system SHALL rollback any partial changes
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators
5. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want export files to be versioned and backward compatible, so that I can import older exports even after database schema changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include a schema version identifier in the export file
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL detect the schema version of the import file
3. IF the import file has an older schema version THEN the system SHALL automatically migrate the data to the current schema
4. IF the import file has a newer schema version THEN the system SHALL display a warning and prevent import
5. WHEN schema migration is required THEN the system SHALL log the migration process and notify the user
6. WHEN creating export files THEN the system SHALL use a standardized format that supports future extensibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the export/import page to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly perform data operations when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to the export/import page
2. WHEN the user is on the export/import page THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions for both operations
3. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL disable relevant buttons to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the current database statistics (number of records)
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide options to return to the main application or perform additional operations
